            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>I am from Burlington, Ontario which is a town in the <abbr title="Greater Toronto Area">GTA</abbr>. I have a black cat named Zen who is turning 16 this October 1<sup>st</sup>, he means the world to me but unfortunately I had to leave him in Toronto with my brother and mom. I work at PetValu in Kanata and love working with animals, <em>especially cute ones.</em></p>
            <p>Last year I moved to Ottawa to pursue further education. I graduated high school in 2020 when COVID-19 hit and it made my graduating year lose its feeling of closure. I worked for several years at different part-time jobs until I decided to pursue college. My dad lives in Stittsville so I packed my things and moved here with the goal of pursuing school, I had lived in Burlington my entire life and felt stuck in my ways. In fall of 2024 I started at Algonquin College in the Business Marketing program, <em>it was not for me.</em> Thankfully my dad was understanding when I told him I wanted to switch to a new program, after some research I found <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> and knew it was going to be a much better fit for me. </p>
