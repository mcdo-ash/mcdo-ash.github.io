            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>I am from Burlington, Ontario which is a town in the <abbr title="Greater Toronto Area">GTA</abbr>. I have a black cat named Zen who is turning 16 this October, he means the world to me but unfortunately I had to leave him in Toronto with my brother and mom. I work at PetValu in Kanata and love working with animals, <em>especially cute ones.</em></p>
